# fedora-custom

fedora-custom is a project created with the aim of creating unofficial ISOs of Fedora Linux for Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

Due to the blocking of the fedora-cisco-openh264 repository by Cisco for Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, regular Fedora Linux images become more difficult to set up initially.

fedora-custom is not a full-fledged distribution. This is an unofficial build. We do not maintain any infrastructure. We rely on ready-made solutions.

## whats added on this builds

The following packages are pre-installed in each image:

- aria2
- wget
