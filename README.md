# fedora-custom

fedora-custom is a project created with the aim of creating unofficial ISOs of Fedora Linux for Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

Due to the blocking of the fedora-cisco-openh264 repository by Cisco for Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, regular Fedora Linux images become more difficult to set up initially.

fedora-custom is not a full-fledged distribution. This is an unofficial build. We do not maintain any infrastructure. We rely on ready-made solutions.

## whats added on this builds

The following packages are pre-installed in each image:

- aria2
- wget
- mc
- git
- firefox
- fastfetch
- unzip
- unxz
- ffmpeg-libs
- unrar

The rpmfusion-free and rpmfusion-nonfree repositories are enabled by default.

Flathub is also enabled by default.

## nvidia-builds

All nvidia-labeled builds contain the latest version of nvidia drivers from rpmfusion

## gnome-default

fedora-gnome-deafult contains standard packages that come in the @gnome-desktop group. Gnome-tweaks is also pre-installed.

## gnome-minimal 

fedora-gnome-minimal contains standard packages that come in the @gnome-desktop group with the exception of gnome-boxes, gnome-classic-session and gnome-connections. Gnome-tweaks is also pre-installed. Recommended instead of gnome-default.

## kde-default

fedora-kde-deafult contains standard packages that come in the @kde-desktop group.
